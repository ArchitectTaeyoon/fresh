  <h1>My <em>Background</em> and <em>Ambitions</em>
  </h1>

  <p> I was born and raised in Seoul, Korea. Seoul is the capital city of Seoul and is one of the most
	  densely populated cities in the world ( according to wikipedia there are 25,620,000 people
	  living in the Metropolitan area as of October, 2014). I have lived in Epsom, Surrey, London for
	  about four years, where I attended primary school and high school. After finishing high school
	  in Seoul, I enrolled in Hongik University School of Architecture. My dream was to become an
	  architect since I was twelve. After finishing two years of my undergraduate study, I joined the
	  military (like all healthy men in Korea do) and served my nation for two years. Then before
	  returning to school, I went backpacking to Spain by myself and travelled through the whole
	  country as well as Portu and Lisbon of Portugal. I had travelled most of Europe as well as Egypt
	  and other asian countries with my family. But travelling alone was a very special
	  experience.After studying Architecture for a year and a half more in Seoul, I decided to
	  transfer to IIT to finish my Bachelor's here, as a dual degree program.
  </p>
  <p>  Since coming to IIT, I had my rough first semester here. Trying to convert from the Metric system
  to the Imperial system was a bigger problem than I had thought - the parts of the models I was
  making wouldn't fit because the measurements were ever-so-slightly off. Then all the materials
  were different too. But I was learning a lot and I knew that is what mattered most. I received
  shitty grades, but decided not to beat myself up over it. It was part of trial and error.
  </p>
  <p>  Now I am pursuing my dream as I always had been - only at a larger scale. I have applied for
  internship at London this Summer, and Study abroad program in Netherlands for the Fall semester. I
  am trying to get out in the world - to refine my skills and experience the various Architecture
  scenes of the world I had always dreamt of. My ambition lies in establishing my own practice and
  school of Architecture at a international scale. It's not that I am after wealth or fame, but I
  wish to master my own Architecture. My dream is to design and build a masterpiece that will live
  on even after my death. Incorporating technology into Architecture is one of concepts that I am
  pursuing.
  </p>
  <p>  Taking this course will play a big role in my professional career. At some point in my
  life, I had to build a website for myself. For Architects, this has become almost a basic
  requirement, where all the firms require a website address from the applicants. And of course, if
  I were to establish my own practice, it is an absolute necessity. I had been putting it off. I
  kept telling myself that I was too busy with Studio work and Competitions to learn how to do all
  of this. There was always a lot of work to be done. But I realised I had to do this NOW. It was
  time.
  </p>
  <p>  I am very excited to be learning how to build a site - from the ground up. This BIOS-like screen
  is really throwing me off, and half of the time I have no idea what is going on. Like that
  Facebook meme - when a code doesn't work, I don't know why, and when it works, I don't know why.
  But it is very entertaining to explore this new world, especially with a doctor helping me out on
  Campfire like a chat-pal. Maybe after some time, I will start to understand those articles on the
  forums. And by the end of this course, perhaps I will have a good idea about how I will design my
  own site - Get out in the world and reach out.
