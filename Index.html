  <body>
    <p>  I was born and raised in Seoul, Korea. Seoul is the capital city of Seoul
    and is one of the most densely populated cities in the world ( according to wikipedia
    there are 25,620,000 people living in the Metropolitan area as of October, 2014). I have
    lived in Epsom, Surrey, London for about four years, where I attended primary school
    and high school. After finishing high school in Seoul, I enrolled in Hongik University School
     of Architecture. My dream was to become an architect since I was twelve. After finishing
     two years of my undergraduate study, I joined the military (like all healthy men in Korea do)
     and served my nation for two years. Then before returning to school, I went backpacking to Spain by myself
     and travelled through the whole country as well as Portu and Lisbon of Portugal. I had travelled most of
     Europe as well as Egypt and other asian countries with my family. But travelling alone was a very special
     experience.After studying
     Architecture for a year and a half more in Seoul, I decided to transfer to IIT to finish my Bachelor's here,
     as a dual degree program.
    </p>
    <p>  Since coming to IIT, I had my rough first semester here. Trying to convert from the Metric system
     to the Imperial system was a bigger problem than I had thought - the parts of the models I was making wouldn't
      fit because the measurements were ever-so-slightly off. Then all the materials were different too.
      But I was learning a lot and I knew that is what mattered most. I received shitty grades, but decided not
      to beat myself up over it. It was part of trial and error.
    </p>
    <p>  Now I am pursuing my dream as I always had been - only at a larger scale. I have applied for internship
     at London this Summer, and Study abroad program in Netherlands for the Fall semester. I am
      trying to get out in the world - to refine my skills and experience the various Architecture scenes of
      the world I had always dreamt of. My ambition lies in establishing my own practice and school of Architecture
      at a international scale. It's not that I am after wealth or fame, but I wish to master my own Architecture. My
       dream is to design and build a masterpiece that will live on even after my death. Incorporating technology
       into Architecture is one of concepts that I am pursuing.
    </p>
    <p>  Taking this course will play a big role in my professional career. At some point in my life,
    I had to build a website for myself. For Architects, this has become almost a basic requirement,
    where all the firms require a website address from the applicants. And of course, if I were to
    establish my own practice, it is an absolute necessity. I had been putting it off. I kept telling
     myself that I was too busy with Studio work and Competitions to learn how to do all of this. There was
      always a lot of work to be done. But I realised I had to do this NOW. It was time.
    </p>
    <p>  I am very excited to be learning how to build a site - from the ground up. This BIOS-like
     screen is really throwing me off, and half of the time I have no idea what is going on.
     Like that Facebook meme - when a code doesn't work, I don't know why, and when it works, I don't know why.
     But it is very entertaining to explore this new world, especially with a doctor helping me out
      on Campfire like a chat-pal. Maybe after some time, I will start to understand those articles on the forums.
      And by the end of this course, perhaps I will have a good idea about how I will design
       my own site - Get out in the world and reach out.
